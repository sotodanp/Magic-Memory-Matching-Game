Magic-Memory-Match-Game
This is a simple game created in the "Build Web App with React & Firebase" course. It's a matching card memory game that counts how many turns it takes you to complete. It has a functioning New game button that restarts the game and turn count.

This is updated code from the original course, which fixes the double-clicking problem which originally chose the matching card for you when you double click fast enough on the same card towards the middle before it flipped.
